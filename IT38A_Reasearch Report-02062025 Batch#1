a. "Comparative Analysis of Successful and Failed Enterprise System Implementations"

b. Case Study 1: Nike, Inc.
b.1. company overview (Why the enterprise system was implemented)
Nike, Inc. is one of the world’s leading sportswear and equipment companies. As the company grew globally, it faced challenges in managing its supply chain and inventory efficiently. Nike used different systems for various business functions, which made it difficult to track inventory, forecast demand, and fulfill customer orders accurately. These problems led to delays, excess stock, and lost sales.

b.2 Implementation Process
Nike started by planning and understanding what the company needed from the new system. It then chose SAP as its ERP system because it could connect different departments like finance, supply chain, and manufacturing. After selecting the system, Nike worked with SAP experts to customize it for the company's specific needs. Employees were trained to use the new system, and Nike also introduced a change management strategy to help workers adapt. The system was launched in different stages, starting with a few key locations before expanding globally. Nike closely monitored the system to fix any issues and improve performance.

b.3 Key Success Factors
Nike's success with the ERP system was due to several key factors. First, the company had a clear goal of improving efficiency and making better decisions. Second, top management fully supported the project and made sure it had enough resources. Third, Nike focused on training employees so they could use the system effectively. Fourth, the company customized the system to fit its needs instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach. Finally, Nike kept monitoring the system after launch to make improvements and ensure it worked smoothly.

b.4 Outcomes & Impact
The ERP system helped Nike improve its operations in many ways. The company became more efficient because different departments could now work together on one system. This also helped reduce costs, especially in warehousing and logistics, since Nike could better manage inventory and avoid having too much or too little stock. Customers had a better experience because products were available when needed. The system also made it easier for Nike to expand globally and manage new markets. Additionally, Nike gained better financial insights, which helped leaders make smarter business decisions.


Case Study 2: Levi Strauss & Co.
c.1 Company Overview (Reason for Implementing the Enterprise System)
Levi Strauss & Co. is a famous jeans company. It wanted to improve how it managed inventory, orders, and finances. The company decided to use an SAP ERP system to make operations faster, reduce costs, and improve decision-making.

c.2 Implementation Process & Challenges
Levi Strauss launched the system in all locations at once, instead of in phases. This caused major problems. Employees were not well-trained, and the system was not tested properly. As a result, orders were delayed, warehouses had issues, and financial reports were inaccurate.

c.3 Key Failure Factors
Poor training: Employees didn’t know how to use the new system.
Big bang rollout: Launching everywhere at the same time made fixing problems harder.
No proper testing: The system had errors that were not fixed before launch.
Integration issues: The new system did not work well with existing processes.

c.4 Outcomes & Consequences
Levi Strauss lost $192 million in sales due to delayed shipments and system failures. Some operations had to shut down temporarily to fix problems. The company had to spend more money to train employees and repair the system. This failure showed the importance of proper planning, testing, and gradual implementation.

d.3. Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned include the following questions:
1. What did the successful case do right? 
  - Nike planned its ERP system carefully. They introduced the system step by step (phased rollout) to reduce risks. They also trained employees well and tested the system before using it fully. Their strong change management helped employees adapt easily.
2. What went wrong in the failed case?
  - Levi Strauss launched the system all at once (big bang rollout), which caused major problems. They did not test it properly before launching. Employees were not trained well, so they struggled to use the system. Poor change management made things worse.
3. How can future implementations avoid similar failures?
  - Use a phased rollout instead of launching everywhere at once.
  - Test the system carefully before full deployment.
  - Provide proper training for employees so they can use the system easily.
  - Have a change management plan to help employees adapt.
  - Make sure the system integrates well with existing business processes.
