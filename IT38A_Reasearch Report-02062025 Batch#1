b.1. company overview (Why the enterprise system was implemented)
Nike, Inc. is one of the worldâ€™s leading sportswear and equipment companies. As the company grew globally, it faced challenges in managing its supply chain and inventory efficiently. Nike used different systems for various business functions, which made it difficult to track inventory, forecast demand, and fulfill customer orders accurately. These problems led to delays, excess stock, and lost sales.

Nike started by planning and understanding what the company needed from the new system. It then chose SAP as its ERP system because it could connect different departments like finance, supply chain, and manufacturing. After selecting the system, Nike worked with SAP experts to customize it for the company's specific needs. Employees were trained to use the new system, and Nike also introduced a change management strategy to help workers adapt. The system was launched in different stages, starting with a few key locations before expanding globally. Nike closely monitored the system to fix any issues and improve performance.

b.3 Key Success Factors
Nike's success with the ERP system was due to several key factors. First, the company had a clear goal of improving efficiency and making better decisions. Second, top management fully supported the project and made sure it had enough resources. Third, Nike focused on training employees so they could use the system effectively. Fourth, the company customized the system to fit its needs instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach. Finally, Nike kept monitoring the system after launch to make improvements and ensure it worked smoothly.

b.4 Outcomes & Impact
The ERP system helped Nike improve its operations in many ways. The company became more efficient because different departments could now work together on one system.

Customers had a better experience because products were available when needed. The system also made it easier for Nike to expand globally and manage new markets. Additionally, Nike gained better financial insights, which helped leaders make smarter business decisions.
